# Perfect Timing: Take Control of When Your Tickets Go on Sale
## New Ticket Availability Controls

**Create excitement, manage demand, and maximize revenue with precise timing control**

---

## üéØ **What This Means for Your Events**

### **Complete Control Over Ticket Sales Timing**
**Stop losing money to poor timing.** Our new availability system gives you precise control over when each type of ticket becomes available for purchase - not just your entire event, but individual ticket types.

**Perfect for your next event:**

- **Early Bird vs. Regular pricing** - Release cheaper tickets first, then automatically switch to regular price
- **VIP ticket drops** - Create excitement by releasing premium tickets at a specific time
- **Member pre-sales** - Give your supporters exclusive access before the public
- **Limited edition releases** - Build anticipation with timed ticket drops
- **Multi-day festivals** - Control when tickets for each day become available

---

## ‚è∞ **How It Actually Works**

### **Set It and Forget It**
**No more manual switching.** Once you set up your timing rules, everything happens automatically:

**Option 1: Set Exact Times**

- Early Bird tickets: Available July 15th at 10:00 AM
- Regular tickets: Available August 1st at 10:00 AM  
- VIP tickets: Available August 15th at 12:00 PM

**Option 2: Set Days Before Your Event**

- Member tickets: Available 30 days before the event
- Public tickets: Available 21 days before the event
- Last-minute tickets: Stop selling 2 days before the event

**Option 3: Manual Control When You Need It**

- Override everything with a simple toggle
- Instantly enable or disable any ticket type
- Perfect for last-minute changes or special circumstances

## üí∞ **Real Revenue Benefits**

### **Early Bird Strategy That Actually Works**
**Encourage early purchases** without losing late buyers:

**Example: Theater Season Launch**

- **Month 1:** Release "Super Early Bird" season passes at $200
- **Month 2:** Regular season passes automatically become available at $250  
- **Month 3:** Individual show tickets open at $35 each
- **Week of show:** Premium rush tickets at $45

**What happens:**

- **Loyal fans** get rewarded with the best price
- **Procrastinators** still buy at higher prices  
- **Walk-ins** pay premium pricing
- **You capture maximum value** from each customer segment

### **Create Genuine Scarcity**
**Build real anticipation** for your premium experiences:

**Example: Exclusive Dinner Show**

- **VIP table tickets:** Available Monday at noon (50 seats)
- **Premium seats:** Available Wednesday at noon (100 seats)
- **General admission:** Available Friday at noon (200 seats)

**Result:** Each release creates a "mini event launch" with social media buzz and urgency.
