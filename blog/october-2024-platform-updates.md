# **How QRTick's October Updates Will Transform Your Event Management**

*New features designed to boost your ticket sales, streamline your operations, and give you the insights you need to grow your events*

---

## **Why These Updates Matter for Your Events**

As an event organiser, you know that every detail matters when it comes to creating successful events. That's why we've spent the past two months developing features that directly address the biggest challenges you face: maximising ticket sales, managing revenue effectively, and providing a smooth experience for your attendees.

These aren't just technical improvements – they're business tools designed to help you grow your events and build stronger relationships with your audience.

## **Choose Your Pricing Strategy**

### **The Challenge**
Every event organiser faces the same dilemma: how to handle processing fees. Some prefer transparent pricing where customers see the full breakdown, while others want to present clean, all-inclusive prices.

### **Your Options**
We've enhanced our platform to give you complete control over how fees are presented:

**Option 1: Smart Fee Absorption** (New)
- Absorb processing fees and present clean pricing to customers
- Customers see "$4,000" instead of "$4,000 + $372 fees"
- You receive the net amount after fees
- Perfect for events where you want to offer "all-inclusive" pricing

**Option 2: Transparent Fee Display** (Original)
- Show customers exactly what they're paying for
- Display the full breakdown: ticket price + processing fees
- You receive the full face value of your tickets
- Ideal for organisers who want complete transparency

### **What This Means for Your Business**
- **Flexibility**: Choose the approach that works best for your event
- **Higher Conversion**: Fee absorption can reduce cart abandonment
- **Transparency**: Original approach builds trust through full disclosure
- **Competitive Advantage**: Both options help you stand out from competitors

### **Real Results**
*"We switched to fee absorption for our dance season and saw a 15% increase in sales. But for our charity events, we prefer the transparent approach so donors know exactly where their money goes."* - Event Organiser, Kingston

## **Make Smarter Decisions with Advanced Analytics**

## **Manage VIPs and Sponsors with Complimentary Tickets**

### **The Need**
Every event organiser needs to provide free tickets for VIPs, press, sponsors, and special guests. Managing these manually is time-consuming and error-prone.

### **Streamlined Complimentary System**
- **Easy Ticket Issuing**: Create free tickets with just a few clicks
- **Capacity Management**: Built-in checks prevent overselling
- **Separate Tracking**: Keep complimentary tickets separate from revenue
- **Automatic Delivery**: Email notifications sent automatically

### **Operational Benefits**
- **Save Time**: No more manual ticket management for VIPs
- **Reduce Errors**: Automated capacity checks prevent overselling
- **Professional Image**: Smooth process for important guests
- **Better Organisation**: Clear separation between paid and complimentary tickets

## **Deliver a Better Experience on All Devices**

### **The Reality**
Your customers use phones, tablets, and computers to buy tickets. If your ticketing system doesn't work well on all devices, you're losing sales.

### **Mobile-First Design**
- **Responsive Cards**: Clean, touch-friendly interface on all devices
- **Fast Loading**: Optimised performance on mobile networks

- **Accessibility**: Works for customers with different devices and abilities

## **Enhanced Security for Your Peace of Mind**

### **The Importance**
Event organisers handle sensitive customer data and financial transactions. You need to know your platform is secure and your customers' information is protected.

### **Advanced Security Features**
- **Secure Authentication**: Multiple layers of protection for admin access
